# monarcle.io

Its a game like Wordle, but for English kings and queens, particularly medieval ones. Its entirely UI driven which means it doesnt have a dependency on a database or any kind of backend. It works by cycling through a predefined list of monarchs depending on what day it is. Its not the best solution but its simple.
